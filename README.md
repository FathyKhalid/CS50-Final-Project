# CS50-Final-Project 

My Final Project for CS50 is a web application using Flask, Python ans SQL based in part
on the web track's distribution code.
The application is named CS50 TODO and it provides the user with the possibility to make
a personal list of things to do.
The list will be only accesible to the user who will be asked to register with  username
and password.
The user will be able to loginand logout.
The user will be able to check and add new things to do to his personal list.
